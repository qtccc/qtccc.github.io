                <h2>Predicting Customer Churn Using K-Nearest Neighbors</h2>
                <p>In this project, I developed a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning (leaving the bank) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset includes customer demographics, account balances, and salary information. I performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling, followed by feature selection to improve model accuracy. The KNN model was implemented from scratch, with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation applied to optimize the choice of K and distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC curve.</p>

                <h2>Kaggle Competition: Enhancing Review Score Prediction with Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>This project explores predictive modeling of review scores using a combination of feature engineering, model optimization, and offline evaluation techniques. By leveraging machine learning methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors, this model was developed to predict review scores based on text, user, and metadata features.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Linear Regression Simulation: Exploring Randomness and Regression Outcomes</h2>
                <p>This project is an interactive web tool designed to demonstrate the impact of randomness on linear regression results. By manipulating parameters such as sample size, mean, variance, and number of simulations, this tool visualizes how changes in these values affect the regression line’s slope and intercept—even when there’s no true relationship between the variables. Through scatter plots and histograms of simulated slopes and intercepts, the project provides insights into how sample size and noise influence the stability and variability of regression estimates.</p>

                <h2>Logistic Regression Cluster Shift Experiment</h2>
                <p>This project explores the impact of shifting clusters in a dataset on the parameters and performance of a logistic regression model. The experiment involves generating datasets with progressively shifted clusters, fitting logistic regression models, and visualizing the resulting decision boundaries, parameter trends, and classification results. Key insights are drawn by analyzing how logistic regression adapts as cluster separation increases, showcasing changes in coefficients, intercepts, and logistic loss. This project highlights the interpretability and effectiveness of logistic regression for linearly separable datasets.</p>
